          <h3>Privacy</h4>
          <h5>CANNOPTIN PRIVACY POLICY</h5>
          <h5>Protecting your privacy at Cannoptin</h5>
          <p>2758616 Ontario Inc., doing business as the Cannoptin (“Cannoptin”) is
            committed to protecting the privacy of its customers, in accordance with
            Ontario’s Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA).
            We only collect personal information that is necessary for our stated purpose of
            providing relevant information relating to and education around products and
            product categories, and other information related to Cannoptin services and
            partners. Information may be shared with researchers in order to fulfil
            Cannoptin’s social responsibility mandate.
            The Cannoptin Privacy Policy describes in more detail the key principles and
            practices followed by Cannoptin with respect to its collection, use, disclosure,
            retention and disposal of personal information.</p>
          <h5>Policy Statement</h5>
          <p>2758616 Ontario Inc., doing business as the Cannoptin (“Cannoptin”) is
            committed to protecting the privacy of its customers, in accordance with
            Ontario’s Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA).
            Cannoptin is responsible for protection of personal information in its custody or
            under its control.  This Policy describes key principles and practices followed by
            Cannoptin with respect to its collection, use, disclosure, retention and disposal of
            personal information.</p>
          <h5>What is Personal Information?</h5>
          <p>Personal information is information about an identifiable individual in their
            personal capacity. It reveals something of a personal nature about the individual,
            and it could reasonably identify the individual if disclosed (either on its own, or in
            combination with other information). Examples of your personal information
            include your name, address, date of birth, email address, telephone number,
            personal views or opinions or social media user identification.</p>
          <h5>What Personal Information Do We Collect and Why?</h5>
          <p>Cannoptin typically collects personal information from customers online. Other
            than as permitted or required by law, Cannoptin will inform you of the purposes
            for which we collect and use personal information in a notice of collection.
            Generally, we collect and use personal information:
          <ul>
            <li>to communicate with you regarding services you have requested;</li>
            <li>to receive and respond to your inquiries;</li>
            <li>to meet legal and regulatory requirements;</li>
            <li>to track and analyze trends and patterns;</li>
            <li>to create aggregated information that does not allow you to be personally
              identified or contacted; and</li>
          </ul>
          The most common situations in which we collect and use your personal information are set out below.</p>
          <h5>Visiting the Cannoptin Website</h5>
          <p>When you visit our website, we will ask for information required so we can
            provide relevant information relating to and education around products and
            product categories, and other information related to Cannoptin services and
            partners.</p>
          <h5>Public Enquiries and Customer Care</h5>
          <p>When you contact Cannoptin with a comment, question or complaint we may
            need to record information in order to respond to you appropriately, including
            details of your enquiry, your name, and your preferred method(s) of contact (such
            as your mailing address, phone number or email address).</p>
          <h5>Cannoptin Partners</h5>
          <p>Personal information will be provided to our partners in order to fulfill services
            you have requested, such as delivery of information and education around
            products, product categories and other information related to our partners. Our
            partners may not otherwise use Cannoptin personal information, and are
            required to comply with strict privacy standards.</p>
          <h5>How is Your Personal Information Secured and Protected?</h5>
          <p>In some cases, personal information may be stored outside of Canada. In
            exceptional circumstances your personal information may be available to
            government authorities under lawful orders and laws applicable in the
            relevant jurisdictions. 
          </br>
            Please be aware, however, that no transmission over the Internet can be
            guaranteed to be completely secure since &quot;perfect security&quot; does not exist on the
            Internet. Consequently, Cannoptin does not represent, warrant, covenant or
            guarantee the complete security of the personal information you provide to
            Cannoptin.</p>
          <h5>Social Media</h5>
          <p>Cannoptin may use accounts on social media platforms to provide the public with
            education or information.
          </br>
          CCannoptin social media accounts are publicly accessible, and your posts,
          comments, replies to and mentions of Cannoptin may be publicly visible,
          depending on your privacy settings.
          </br>
          Your privacy and the retention of information on social media accounts are governed by the  privacy policies of the parties that operate these social networks.
          </br>
           Some social media platforms may allow you to control the information you make available to   Cannoptin and others. Users should review privacy policies and terms and conditions of the parties that operate these platforms prior to deciding to participate.
          </br>
           Cannoptin does not have any control over such platforms, and therefore we have no responsibility or liability for the manner in which their operators collect, use, disclose, secure and otherwise treat your personal information. 
          </br>
          Cannoptin may collect and measure information available to us about social media activity in order to provide content that is relevant and potentially interesting to users of these social media platforms.</p>

          </br>
          We may use either or both types of cookies: persistent and session. Persistent
cookies are stored on your computer or mobile device when you visit certain
websites, while session cookies expire when you close your browser. Session
cookies facilitate your use and navigation of our websites, while persistent
cookies identify your browser and IP address, but do not collect personal
information.
          </br>
          Users can control and refuse to accept cookies from our websites at the
individual browser. Some browsers can be set to accept all cookies, reject all

          <h5>Use of Cannoptin Website Data</h5>
          <p>
            We use cookies and server log data to analyze operational trends and
performance; and for statistical purposes and for ways to improve all of our
websites. </br> In addition, we use web analytics services, including Google Analytics, to help us
understand how people use the site. </br> Cookies allow web analytics services to recognize your browser or device and,
for example, identify whether you have visited our websites before, what you
have previously viewed or clicked on, and how you found us. The information is
anonymous and only used for statistical purposes. It helps us to analyze patterns
of user activity and to develop a better user experience. The web analytics
service does not allow us or our analytics service providers to identify individuals.
You can find more information about how Google Analytics collects and
processes data at the following
link: https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites </br>  You can opt out of analytics activity by setting your browser to refuse to accept
cookies from our websites. Google also offers a free Google Analytics opt-out

tool for certain browsers. However, the browser deactivation add-on offered by
Google Analytics does not prevent information from being transmitted to us
(please see the “CANNOPTIN Website Server Log Data” section of this Policy).
You can find additional information on how to install the browser add-on by
searching Goolge for “Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on”
